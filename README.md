# Siteswap #

This application is for uber juggling nerds to find and visualize new juggling patterns using siteswap notation. The application allows jugglers to specify the number of objects they want to juggle, the length of the pattern, and the minimum and maximum throw height they wish to use. Jugglers can also request to return patterns that include or exclude specific subsequences.

I built this app as part of an agile software development apprenticeship at 8th Light. Since this application represents one of my first adventures in Ruby, I appreciate any feedback that could help me improve Siteswap and my overall understanding of Ruby.
